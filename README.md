Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new stable release versions of NamoCoin.

NamoCoin (NAMO) is a Pow/Pos Altcoin Network. It uses hashing algorithm NIST5 and block times are 120 seconds, rewards are 20 Namo per block and stake interest is %5 per year.
