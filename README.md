//NAMO offers several important features that Bitcoin does not. First, NAMO rewards people for running a NAMO node. Whereas Bitcoin transactions are completely traceable, NAMO enables you to send coins anonymously. There is never any need to 'mix' or 'anonymize' your NAMO â€” they are anonymous by default. NAMO is fully integrated with NAMO, which means that a snoop or attacker watching your internet connection will not know if you are using NAMO and other NAMO users cannot determine the physical location of your NAMO node. NAMO also offers encrypted end-to-end messaging between NAMO users.
